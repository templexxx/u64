# U64

Unsigned 64-bit Integer Set in Go.

>- **High Performance:**
>
>   Read Optimized: Supports one write goroutine and multi read goroutine.
>   Read is wait-free and Cache-friendly, which means only needs few atomic read sequentially.
>   
>- **Rich Features:**
>
>   Search, Insert, Delete, List
>
>- **Low Overhead**
>
>   Although it can't compress digits, comparing other implementation which supports dynamically updating, it does save
>   memory because there is no pointer. Each key needs about 10Bytes, overhead is 25%.
>
>- **Auto Scaling**
>
>   Shrinking automatically: If there is no new key for a long time(default: 2minutes), and the most part of buckets are
>   garbage(default: 1/4 usage), the set will try to shrink.
>
>   Expand automatically: When meet ErrNoSpace, it'll trigger expanding. The size will grow up to 2x as before.

## Performance Tuning

### No Neighbour Bitmap

AVX atomic & extra 100% overhead

Compare benchmark:

### Using TSC register to get timestamp

## Limitation

1. The maximum size of set is 32Mi, but big enough for most cases. I set the limitation for avoiding unexpected memory
usage.

## Other Set Implementations

### Tree

We could make a Cache-friendly tree, but in Go, it's almost impossible to make an uint64 tree set without the pointer
overhead, so the space cost is at least 2x.

### Other Hash Set

The overhead is matter in normal hash set, because of the bucket linker. And it's really hard to make it wait-free.

### Others

Actually the major issues are getting the balance of memory usage and performance. It's not a easy job, so I decide to
do it by myself.

## Mathematics

u64.Set has two buckets for saving uint64 keys, there will be only one bucket could be written. If one is full, try to 
add key into the other one.

The probability of both buckets meet no space error is a serious problem, if the probability is high, the whole design
of the structure is unreliable.

The conclusion is: up to 5.47e-28

It's about 300Î¼g/the Earth's Oceans.

### The Proof

The mathematics proof is quite direct and simply:

We assume the load factor is 0.75 in the older bucket which is the maximum load factor of one bucket, then we make a 2x size
bucket, after transferring all keys into the new one, the new one's load factor is 0.375 now.

The rate of each entry is not empty is 0.375.

The neighbour size is 64.

`P = 0.375^64 = 5.47e-28`
